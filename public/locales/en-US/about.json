		"intro1": "<p><strong>DollarBlacklist</strong> is a reputation system for <em>USD</em> currency bills, where users can query banknotes by their serial number, value and series year, and immediately see a summary of the reviews that other users have made on the banknote, and thus determine with the greatest possible security the <strong>authenticity</strong> of the bill.</p>",
		"intro2": "<p>In addition to providing a summary of reviews made by other users, DollarBlacklist lists the <strong>security features</strong> that the bill consulted should have, and how to use them to determine whether the bill is real or counterfeit.</p>",
		"users": "<h2>Types of users</h2><p>There are two types of users:</p><ul><li>Regular</li><li>Business</li></ul><p>The only difference between both types of users is that the reviews made by <strong>businesses</strong> in general are more reliable than those made by <strong>regular users</strong>.</p>",
		"reviews": "<h2>Reviews</h2><p>There are two types of reviews:</p><ul><li><h3>Good review: authentic banknotes</h3><p>Users can leave an optional public comment and must specify a number from 1 to 5, which refers to the physical conditions of the banknote.</p></li><li><h3>Bad review: counterfeit banknotes</h3><p>Users can leave an optional public comment and must specify the defects of the banknote that are considered a failure in the security features.</p></li></ul>",
		"reviewsNotes": "<p><strong>Important:</strong> in order to submit reviews, users must allow DollarBlacklist to know their location, since this information is an essential part of the review, and is used to position on a map the city where the review was performed.</p><p>A user is only allowed to submit one review of one type (good or bad) of a single banknote.</p>",
		"securityFeatures": "<h2>About the security features</h2><p>Each banknote denomination has different security features, which vary depending on the series year.</p><p>All information regarding the security features of the banknotes of each denomination of each serial year has been obtained from the <em>official website of the U.S. currency</em>: <a href='https://www.uscurrency.gov'>www.uscurrency.gov</a></p>"
